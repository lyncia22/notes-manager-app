You are my senior full-stack engineer. I’m building a MERN “Notes Manager App” for a job interview. I need you to help me design, code, and debug the entire project step by step.

Project Objective: A full-stack app where users can register/login, create, view, edit, and delete notes. Admins (optional bonus) can view all users/notes and delete inappropriate ones.

Tech stack & constraints:
– Frontend: React (with React Router, Axios for API calls, optional Tailwind for styling).
– Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB (Mongoose).
– Authentication: JWT (with bcrypt for password hashing).
– Deployment: Netlify (frontend) + Render/Heroku (backend).
– Database: MongoDB Atlas.

Features:

User registration & login (email + password).

CRUD operations for notes (title + description).

Logout option.

Bonus Admin panel: list all users, list all notes, delete notes.

Deliverables:
– Clean, modular, production-ready code with comments.
– REST APIs following best practices.
– Protected routes (JWT middleware).
– Error handling and input validation.
– GitHub repo with README.md (setup + run instructions).
– Short demo video.
– If possible, deployment on Netlify + Render.

How to help me:
– Break the project into clear steps (setup backend, auth APIs, notes APIs, frontend pages, connecting frontend/backend, deployment).
– At each step, generate working code with explanations.
– Suggest folder structure, environment variable management, and best practices.
– Give me example .env and seed data.
– Keep code minimal but professional.

Always think like a senior engineer mentoring me: provide explanations, spot mistakes early, and ensure the project is job-interview quality.
